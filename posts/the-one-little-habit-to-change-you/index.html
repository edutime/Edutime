        The One Little Habit to Change You
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ex-Navy SEAL Commander Sir Admiral William H. McRaven has been a 
        Four Star SEAL officer who had done the encounter of
        terrorist Group leaders including Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein.
        His simple habit to make his bed neat just after waking up has changed his life a lot.
        While McRaven was pursuing his training, every morning his instructor used to inspect the bed
        where the bedsheet must be neatly spread, pillow exactly below the headrest and the extra blanket
        must be cleanly folded and placed in the rack. If one of these points gets unchecked, the cadet had 
        to face severe punishment.
        <br><br>
        The point in this was that if one is not even able to make his bed good for the next sleep,
        how would he be able to compete such big special operations?
        An Ordinary person's day starts with ignorance, he thinks that who would care if make my bed or not.
        but if he makes his bed after waking then he'll complete the first task of his day.
        This will emerge feeling of pride in his mind which will help in encouraging to do
        other tasks of the day.
        Even if the day goes bad and unhappy, the clean and tidy bed  for you to rest will create a positiveness in him 
        that at least he have done something good and hope for the next day to be good.
        It will help him realize that little things in our life also matter.
        <br><br>
        This habit crops a 100% chance to emerge positiveness in one's life.
        The way you do one thing is the way you do everything.
