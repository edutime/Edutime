            Aggregation of Marginal Gains
        </h1>
          The Story of British Cycling Team
          <img src="../../assets/images/improve.png" alt="">
          <p>
          Team Sky won only a single Olympic Medal from 1908 to 2003. 
          Even they had worst performance on Tour de France.
          Seeing this a British cycle manufacturing company 
          declined to give cycles to them, 
          afraid if their sales and reputation would get diminished.
        </p>
        <div class="images">
           <img src="../../assets/images/teamsky.jpg" alt="">
          <img src="../../assets/images/davebrailsford.jpeg" alt="">
         
        </div>
        <p>
          Feeling constant deprivation of performance day by day,
          the Cycling Organisation hired Dave Brailsford as new coach.
          Dave was totally different from other coaches as 
          he worked with a startegy called as "Aggregation of Marginal Gains"
          which means that if we improve every small part of our work, 
          the result will get more excellent. He also applied this principle for 
          the Team. He redesigned the seat to make them more comfortable, 
          tried various fabrics for the players which were lightweight,
          rubbed alcohol to the tyre for good grip. He didn't stopped at this, 
          he made special pillows and mattresses so the rider could get quality 
          sleep and also tried best handwashing technique to avoid getting sick 
          and tried to improve everything related by cycles one percent.
          This resulted Team Sky to win 60% of Gold medals in 2008 Olympic 
          games held in Beijing and next they made 9 Olympic records and 7
          world records in London Olympic. Dave Brailsford's this stategy made 
           an ordinary team win 178 championship, 66 paraolympic and olympic gold medals 
           and 5 Tour de France championships.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, we don't even notice 1% improvement but in long run,
            it comes to be very effective.
          </p>
